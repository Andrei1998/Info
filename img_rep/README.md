# Project Title

Python script for performing image inpainting of dead pixels.

### Prerequisites

NumPy and PIL (i.e. Pillow) need to be installed in order for the script to work properly. Install them by running this command from the project directory after cloning the repository:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example

Suppose we start with this image:

![alt text](data/img/dog1.jpg)

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
